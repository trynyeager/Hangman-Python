# Hangman-Pytohn

A terminal-based Hangman game built in Python. This project features ASCII art, color-coded feedback, and hidden developer "cheat codes."

## Features
* **Dynamic Visuals:** 7-stage ASCII hangman that updates in real-time.
* **ANSI Colors:** Integrated terminal colors for a better UX:
    * 🟢 **Green:** Correct guesses and winning screen.
    * 🔴 **Red:** Wrong guesses and game-over alerts.
* **Dev Commands:**
    * Typing `cheat` toggles a hint showing the target word.
    * Typing `win` allows for instant termination (useful for testing).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.x**
* Works on Windows (uses `cls` for screen clearing).

### Installation & Execution
1.  Clone this repository or download the `hangman.py` file.
2.  Open your terminal/command prompt.
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```
